## How to add a custom  Exercise to ExersicesConfig.json
1. Copy and paste a template from the json File
2. Change the Name to your Exersices name
3. Think about how many reps for each difficulty you would make (if you change Seconds to true, this is not relevant)
4. Think about what muscles will be trained with this exersice ( all above 6 will be taken )
5. Specify a tutorial. ( If you don't have one, just set it to an empty string )
